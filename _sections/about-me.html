<p>
    We are an international team of developers, CS students and non-developers contributing in open-source.

    Our vision is to learn technologies by building projects together while encouraging new members who are
    looking for their first IT dream job or want a career change.
    
    Here you'll gain the real world experience university doesn't give to you and you'll have the opportunity
    to build your portfolio!
